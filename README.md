# Jacek UI theme

Originally from **Hip Light UI theme**

A hip new take on the atom light theme for interface components with some
animation thrown in for a cherry on top.

A lot of the color decisions will be based off the current color scheme of my
personal site and it is best used with the Solarized Light Syntax Theme.

Cheers!
